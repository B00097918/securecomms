#### Running Labs (Use Linux)
I'm running all labs on [Kali 2020.1](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) So you should have the latest version of Kali installed to follow along, but any current Linux distro should be fine also. While some of the labs can be easily run on Windows you are better in the long run creating a Linux VM and using it for all of the labs.
